Task 6
------
I looked up how 'to edit a commit message' and came across the help forum https://help.github.com/articles/changing-a-commit-message/ .  I used the command git commit --amend like it said.

Task 7
------
I ran the following code:
jesus@compsci:~/CAAP-CS$ git clone https://github.com/junegunn/fzf FZF
Cloning into 'FZF'...
remote: Counting objects: 7535, done.
remote: Total 7535 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 7535
Receiving objects: 100% (7535/7535), 2.55 MiB | 1.41 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (4709/4709), done.

Then I used 'git log' and looked for the comment.  I got tired of looking through the terminal output so I looked online how to take a command output and put it into a text file.  I found my answer on: 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/420981/how-do-i-save-terminal-output-to-a-file

I ran the following command:
jesus@compsci:~/CAAP-CS/FZF$ git log > /home/jesus/CAAP-CS/Lab0/FZF_log.txt

Then I opened the text file and use control-f to quickly find the comment.  The commit SHA is c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168 and the commit comment is ' Add --no-mouse option to replace FZF_MOUSE_ENABLED'

Task 8
------
I looked up 'how to use git to check changes made to a file.  I found my answer on:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4456532/how-can-i-see-what-has-changed-in-a-file-before-committing-to-git

I used the command 'git diff [filename]' as the website suggested and it worked.  The command output the lines on the text file and had a '+' in front of the additions.

Task 9
------
I looked up 'how to remove files from a git repository' and I found my answer on:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2047465/how-can-i-delete-a-file-from-git-repo

I used the command:
jesus@compsci:~/CAAP-CS/Lab0$ git rm mistake.txt
rm 'Lab0/mistake.txt'

Task 10
-----
I looked up 'how to negate git commits' and found a hint on:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/642264/undo-change-in-git-not-rewriting-history

I looked up the documentation of 'git revert' on:
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert

I used the following command:
jesus@compsci:~/CAAP-CS/Lab0$ git revert 833474804eba390433d05f3584365fcb99ed5762 5cc44e146417e04865fc64ecd4044e4524096ae8
