				<h1>INNOVATIVE. INGENIOUS. INDIE.</h1>
				<p>"Impractical Creations is a small, independent game developer.  We specialize in the creation of conceptual games.  Our goal is to push the medium of video games to new frontiers.  Our games are an exploration of narrative, aesthetics, mechanics, and other facets of design.  
				Our design philosophy is centered around innovation.  We want our games to be of a novel and intelligent nature."</p>

				<h1>GAMES AS ART.</h1>
				<p>"Video games have existed for 60 years.  They were conceived as mere diversions, software with the purpose of entertainment.  As time has progressed, video games have become exponentially more complex.  Nonetheless, they are still seen by most as mere means of diversion.
                And yet, the interactive digital median holds endless possibilities.  Entertainment is but one of the many ends.  Video games can convey meaning and emotion just as well as any other medium.  Sadly this avenue is underexplored.  Our games are designed to expose more people to this concept.  
                It is our hope that one-day video games will be seen as an artistic medium."</p>
